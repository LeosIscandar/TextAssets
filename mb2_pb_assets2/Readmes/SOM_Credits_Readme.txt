Description:

Super Open Mode [SOM] is a full authentic setup with the following notable features:

1) Each team has access to about 40 classes modeled after enhanced versions of the better known open mode classes. (Soldier, Hero, Bounty hunter, etc.)
2) The classes are designed to be as powerful as possible without failing to preserve balance and class variety/diversity
3) For the sake of #2 some of the classes like jedi have been broken up into several distinct classes, though individually they are still stronger than the open mode counterparts
4) These classes are mirrors of eachother so that, for example, rebels have access to super battle droids and imperials have access to clone troopers. Jedi / Sith get the same kinds of force powers as well. 
5) There are no player caps on classes


**Assume for any class changes that the changes apply to variants on both teams equally**


-Version 2.3- 

Changes from previous version:
-Added Republic/Imperial Commando Class
-Nerfed mystic/witch (Removed force heal)
-Shortened descriptions [Remove force/AP/BP info]

-Altered Chaingunner class to use a double ROF but halved damage clone rifle 3

-Version 2.4-

Changes from previous version:
- Updated descriptions to remove force data already present, any references to killbots
- Changed playermodels to become 'more generic' - i.e. avoid using named characters AMAP
- Lowered Jedi Acrobat AP, Force Regen, and Force pool to compensate for getting force protect
- Remove SBD I blast armor (inadvertantly makes the class better against melee/grenades), lowered modelscale to 1.1
- Changed SBD adv logic to lvl 2, lowered model scale to 1.1, reduced speed
- Lowered Wookiee brawler health to 800
- Gave force empower to mystic
- Changed weapon models when/where it seemed appropriate, should be purely cosmetic
- Gave Dash to ewoks

-Version 2.5-

**Force Empower removed from the FA until changes are made to make it less dangerous when spammed**
**SOM_Heroes2 and SOM_Villains2 selects different mbch files where *none* of the classes have team heal abilities going forward this character file will be designed for competitive play. **

- Moved character details to the top of the class description

- Magnaguard: 
	Removed Cortosis & Mag plating, Increased armor to 80, added assemble
- Mystic: 
	Removed Empower, Destruction reduced to level 1, Heal reduced to level 2, Gave blinding level 1, Removed passive healing ability (force power is retained)
	iPod: 	The force cost of the low level destruction and blinding should make spamming them rather dangerous, particularly for a class that has a low health pool. 
		This current configuration should be balanced.
