description	"The Chaingunner

Weaponry:

z-9 Rotary Blaster Cannon: (3)

Attributes:

Magnetic Plated Armor: (X)
Close Combat Training: (2)

Strengths: Devestating Against Gunners, and particularly effective at long range against jetpack classes. 

Weaknesses: Sluggish and very vulnerable to grenades and other explosives.

Details:

The Chaingunner is, effectively, a supplement to the Super Battle droid class, the key difference between the two is that while the SBD has comparatively greater armor, the Chaingunner's special z-9 Rotary Cannon can release a Volley of super-fast projectiles that are almost impossible to dodge. As such, the Chaingunner is signifigantly more effective against air targets than the SBD.
