LANG_ENGLISH        "A powerful, graceful weapon used by the Jedi and Sith, described by Obi-Wan Kenobi as an 'elegant weapon from a more civilized age, not as clumsy or random as a blaster.' Lightsabers are difficult weapons to wield indeed, requiring much skill and practice to be used effectively. To beings familiar with swords and Vibroblades, the small weight of the saber is concentrated entirely in the hilt, and a strong gyroscopic effect is generated by the powerful weightless plasma blade. In MovieBattles 2, humanoid armor provides a small amount of resistance against lightsaber damage (20%, meaning that 100 armor will absorb 120 saber damage).\n\nSaber Styles :\n\nBlue --\nA fast stance which does not slow down movement while swinging, with strong defense but weaker offense in Saber versus Saber. Deals 120 base damage per slash and slashes are very fast. Especially effective against gunner classes with low HP such as the Soldier, and the Commander without armor level 3. Against saberists, Blue style's strength lies in wearing down opponents over time by gaining more ACM than them, rather than ending fights quickly.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Drains 6 BP upon Perfect Blocking.\n\n\nYellow --\nDeals 240 base damage per slash. This style is the most basic, and at the same time the most versatile stance in the game.\n\nSpecial Abilities: It does not suffer from BP drains upon failing a MBlock.\n\n\nRed --\nThis stance has long windups for full swings and weaker defense but slashes deal heavy HP damage (450), BP drain, and it has a very strong special attack (see Special Attacks page). Effective at close range in Saber versus Saber because it has very quick counters and swing chains thus its strength lies in ending sabering battles quickly, and against slow gunner classes with high HP (Wookiee, SBD, Droideka).\n\nSpecial Abilities: Scoring a bodyhit on the second swing of a chain will cause the third swing to stagger the opponent. Does not suffer from BP drains when MBlocked.\n\n\nCyan style (or Tavion style) --\n This fast stance benefits from the fastest starting swings, and, like Blue style, does not slow down movement while swinging. Slightly more offensive than Blue style, deals 120 HP damage per hit. It has roughly the same tactical patterns as Blue Style.\n\nSpecial Abilities: It combo-breaks the opponent on a Perfect Parry.\n\n\nPurple (or Desann style) --\n A strong stance, with slightly faster starting swings but less powerful than Red style, deals 320 HP damage per hit. Effective strategies to use this style are similar to Red style's against gunners, however in Saber versus Saber it is proficient at wearing opponents down over time due to its ACC gain ability.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Is able to gain 1 ACC per enemy saber swing chain by perfect blocking a swing from the chain.\n\n\nDuals (Green / Two Lightsabers) --\nThis stance has extremely fast attacks, and as such is able to dish furious combinations quickly draining BP from an opponent, although it has an average defense. Deals 360 HP damage per hit. Against saberists, this stance has powerful offense allowing to overwhelm fast styles such as Blue and Cyan.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Consecutive chained swings drain 0.75x as much BP as normal swings compared to 0.5x for other styles. Its decent damage (260) paired with very fast swings makes it effective against heavy gunner classes (Wookiee, SBD, Droideka) and destructible objects. Has an especially wide arc for blocking saber slashes and blaster fire (1.5x size).\n\n\nStaff (White / Double-Bladed Lightsaber) --\nThe Staff style has a strong base defense (similar to Blue style's) and average attack power. Deals 260 HP damage per hit. Against saberists this stance has strong defensive capabilities, especially against slower styles such as Red and Purple.\n\nSpecial Abilities: MBlocking a swingblock will stagger the attacker; additionally, MBlocking no longer requires camera aim, only movement + attack tapping. Has an especially wide arc for blocking saber slashes and blaster fire (1.5x size).\n\n\n\nNote: For more detailed information on Jedi abilities such as the Saber Defense ability, see the Jedi / Sith class description in the class guide. For info on dueling and detailed description of the styles' abilities, see the Strategy section (Saber versus Saber and Saber versus Gun)."

It is possible to defend against them with a lightsaber, by parrying them (cancelling them out with your own normal swing or special attack). Some have different functionality than Base JA.\n\nLunge (Blue / Fast style) - Crouch + Forward + Attack \n- A solid hit will deal heavy knockback to an opponent.\n\nOverhead Slash / YDFA (Yellow / Medium) - Jump + Forward + Attack\n- An attack that staggers the opponent and if aimed carefully can reach behind the opponent's defenses for a 1-hit KO, and otherwise deals good BP drain. Cyan style has a similar special move, but performs a mid-air stab instead of a slash and deals more BP damage instead of staggering. \n\nRDFA (Red / Strong Style) - Jump + Forward + Attack\n- A powerful slash that does massive BP drain and can knockdown opponents.\n\nButterfly (Staff & Duals) - Jump + Direction + Attack\n- A powerful aerial flurry of attacks that can deal heavy BP drain. Duals can only do a forward butterfly, while Staff can do forwards and sideways butterfly attacks.\n\nTwirl (Staff & Duals) - Crouch + Forward + Attack\n- A rapid flurry of attacks that can quickly drain the BP of an opponent at point blank range, but can leave you vulnerable to attacks from behind.\n\nDouble Stabs (Duals) - Use + Backwards/Left/Right + Attack\n- Stabs with long range that deal BP drain and knockback. Press backwards to do stabs that go infront of and behind you, or press Left or Right to do stabs out to either side.\n\nRoll Stab (All Saber Styles) - Forward Roll + Attack -\nA powerful stab that deals moderate BP drain with a body hit, staggers the target, and pushes him backwards.\n\nBackslash (All Saber Styles) - Use + Backward + Attack\n- Must be used when the opponent is behind you. Deals knockback and moderate BP drain.\n\nCartwheel (All Styles except Staff) - Jump + Left/Right + Attack\n- Doing a cartwheel and then slashing out of the landing allows you to do a Half-Swing (see Advanced Dueling under the Strategy section). Also useful for dodging slashes and avoiding BP drain. \n\nPurple Kata (Desann/Purple style) - Crouch + Forward + Attack\n- A useful attack to surprise enemies attacking recklessly, deals moderate amounts of BP damage."

LANG_ENGLISH        "Melee fighting is generally the last solution when losing all ammo or BP, however it can be powerful in the right hands. It may also be used to make traps (unexpected knockdowns) or harm lightsaber users (though it is rather dangerous). For Wookiees melee is a very powerful weapon, and instead of kicks they use a claw attack which can be used while moving. SBD and Droideka cannot use melee, however the SBD can knock enemies down with a powerful slap. Soldiers must buy the Close Combat Training ability to use melee effectively, but will still be weaker than other classes due to getting up slower than any other class. \n\nJedi/Sith generally have the advantage in melee as they can leap up quickly from knockdown, even doing jump kicks, whereas most armored gunner classes get up more slowly. Most melee attacks are armor-ignoring as well, except for melee katas. However, the only thing able to defeat a Wookiee in Melee is likely another Wookiee.\n\nBlocking using the reload key allows punches, kicks, and some special attacks (but not katas) to be blocked given enough stamina (represented by a yellow bar where ammo would normally be) is available. Blocking a punch as it hits you triggers a short counter-attack on the attacker dealing roughly 10-20 damage.\n\n\nMoves :\nPunch (Primary Fire) -\nDamage = 8 (right hand), 7 (left hand)\n\nKick (Secondary Fire) - \nDamage = 5\n\nKata (Primary + Secondary Fire) -\n Grabbing an opponent with this move allows you to carry out long, heavy damage-dealing attack which can be canceled by switching weapons. Holding a certain direction while grabbing allows you to perform different katas, a choke and forward throw (no direction), a triple punch combo (Forward), and a front-and-back double flip slam. Each kata has a slightly different speed and total damage, but each kata does at least 50 damage.\nIf you kata while someone is directly behind you, you will flip them over your back to your front for 20 damage.\n\nSpecial Attacks:\nUppercut - (Forward + Use + Primary Fire); crushes the guard of the opponent in one blow, but has short range\nDamage = 12\n\nSweep Kick - (Crouch + Alt. Attack); knocks over anyone but crouched enemies who are guarding/blocking\nDamage = 2, 20 if opponent is already knocked over\n\nJump Kick - (Forward + Use + Alt. Attack); has slightly more damage and force than a regular kick, but has a long cooldown and is difficult to aim\nDamage = 8\n\nFlying Kick - (In-Air + Alt. Attack); a powerful kick easily performed by Jedi and Sith\nDamage = 8 \n\nNote that some melee moves may be used while wielding a lightsaber (turned on), the left/right/backward kicks, the forward jumpkick, the sweep kick and the flying kicks (for all of which, holding the use button and pressing Class Special 2 instead of pressing Alt.
