After learning of Morgan Katarn's death at the hands of Jerec, Kyle Katarn chose to continue his murdered father's mission of protecting the Valley of the Jedi's immense power from being abused.
In the process of fighting through Jerec's minions, Kyle managed to teach himself a great deal about the Force and the ways of the Jedi, struggling with his own inner Dark Side, and walking the path of the Light.
Although a mere novice, Kyle's untrained ability in the force is significantly enhanced by the hundreds of souls entombed in the Valley of the Jedi."
