description	"Rako Hardeen

Class Summary: 
A dexterous jetpack sniper.

Weapons:
- Pistol (2)
- DC-17m (Sniper)

Abilities: 
- Dexterity (2)
- Jetpack 

While celebrating his high-profile kill at Trueping's cantina, Rako Hardeen was summoned into the back room to meet his employer and receive payment. There, he was met by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobiâ€“his supposed victim, now physically altered to look like him. Hardeen was apprehended by the two Jedi, and his identity assumed by Kenobi in order to plant himself in a Republic prison. Hardeen's reputation for having killed a Jedi was essential to the plan, as Kenobi used it to gain the trust of other prisoners and attract the attention of Moralo Eval, from whom Kenobi was to acquire intel that would help the Jedi prevent a kidnapping attempt."
